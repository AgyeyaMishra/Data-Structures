### How It Works

Here, we see a lot of the string methods in action. The startswith method is used to find out whether the string 
starts with the given string. The in operator is used to check if a given string is a part of the string.

The find method is used to locate the position of the given substring within the string; find returns -1 if 
it is unsuccessful in finding the substring. The str class also has a neat method to join the items of a sequence
with the string acting as a delimiter between each item of the sequence and returns a bigger string generated from this.
