# String Structures

Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.

Declaring a string is as simple as declaring a one dimensional array. Below is the basic syntax for declaring a string in C programming language.

```
char str_name[size];
```
