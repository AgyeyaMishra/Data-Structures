# Arrays in C
An array is collection of items stored at continuous memory locations.

Why do we need arrays?
We can use normal variables (v1, v2, v3, ..) when we have a small number of objects, but if we want to store a large number of instances, it becomes difficult to manage them with normal variables. The idea of an array is to represent many instances in one variable.
